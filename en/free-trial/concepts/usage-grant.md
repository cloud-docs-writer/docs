# Grant terms of use

At the beginning of the trial period, a grant is credited to your billing account for at least 4000&nbsp;rubles that expires in 60 days.
Starting from September 2, 2019 the initial grant terms of use differ for individual and business accounts.

## For individual accounts

The grant is provisionally divided into two parts and distributed among services as follows:

- _The first part_: 1000&nbsp;rubles from the total grant amount. It can be used to pay for Yandex Compute Cloud services (including virtual machine images).
- _The second part_: 3000&nbsp;rubles from the total grant amount. It can be used to pay for other Yandex.Cloud services.

Both parts can be used simultaneously.

## For business accounts

The grant terms of use depend on the payment method you select when registering and creating your billing account:
