# Upgrading to the paid version

You don't automatically upgrade to the paid version once the trial period ends. To upgrade to the paid version, go to the **Billing** page in the management console and click **Upgrade to the paid version**.

## Using the remainder of the initial grant

{% include [billing-how-to-use-grant](../../_includes/billing-how-to-use-grant.md) %}

The grant terms of use remain in effect upon upgrade:

{% list tabs %}

- For individual accounts

   A remainder of [part](usage-grant.md) of the grant is only used to pay for the intended service or services.

- For business accounts

   The grant terms of use depend on the payment method you select when creating your billing account:

   | Payment method | Using the grant |
   | ----- | ----- |
   | Bank transfer | The remainder of the grant can be used to pay for any Yandex.Cloud services. |
   | Bank card | The remainder of [part](usage-grant.md) of the grant can only be used to pay for its intended service or services. |

{% endlist %}

## Service payment

In Yandex.Cloud, you pay for services based on the amount of resources consumed. For detailed instructions on how to pay for resources after upgrading to the paid version, see the Billing [documentation](../../billing/).

## Examples

{% list tabs %}

- Example 1

   You registered an individual account.

   In 25 days, you spent 1000&nbsp;rubles on Yandex Compute Cloud and 2500&nbsp;rubles on other services. Since you fully spent a part of the grant, the trial period terminates automatically and access to Yandex.Cloud services is suspended unless you upgrade to the paid version.

   At the same time, you have 35 days until the grant expires (60 - 25).

   If you upgrade to the paid version within 30 days, you can use the remainder of the grant until it expires:
   - (3000&nbsp;-&nbsp;2500) = 500 rubles for services other than Compute Cloud.

- Example 2

   You registered a business account with the **Bank card** payment method.

   In 20 days, you spent 500 rubles on Yandex Compute Cloud and 3000&nbsp;rubles on other services. Since you fully spent a part of the grant, the trial period terminates automatically and access to Yandex.Cloud services is suspended unless you upgrade to the paid version.

   If you upgrade to the paid version within 30 days, you can use the remainder of the grant until it expires:
    - (1000&nbsp;- 500) = 500 rubles for Compute Cloud.
