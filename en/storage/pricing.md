# Pricing policy for {{ objstorage-name }}

{% include [use-calculator](../_includes/pricing/use-calculator.md) %}

{% include [currency-choice](../_includes/pricing/currency-choice.md) %}

## What goes into the cost of using {{ objstorage-short-name }} {#rules}

The cost of {{ objstorage-name }} usage is based on:

- The amount of storage used by your data.
- The number of operations on your data.
- The amount of outgoing traffic.

Users can access:

- Cold storage: a low rate for data storage and a high rate for operations. It is optimal for storing a large volume of data with a small number of operations on it.
- Standard storage: a high rate for data storage and a low rate for operations. It is optimal for storing a small amount of data with a large number of operations on it.

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### Using storage {#rules-storage}

Storage usage is measured in GB per month. The volume of data stored during a month is the average value over the month based on per-second data. The minimum pricing unit is 1 hour of storing 1 MB of data.

### Performing operations on data {#rules-operations}

Operations on data are rated according to the rules:

  - The minimum pricing unit for PUT operations is 10.
  - The minimum pricing unit for GET and HEAD operations is 100.
  - You are not charged for deleting data (the DELETE operation).

## Prices {#prices}

### Data storage {#prices-storage}

Prices are specified for a 30-day month. For shorter months, the price is higher. For longer months, it is lower.

- Prices in USD

  | Service | Rate for 1 GB per month, without VAT
  | ----- | -----
  | Standard storage | $0.016166 |
  | Cold storage |  $0.008605 |

- Prices in roubles

  | Service | Rate for 1 GB per month, with VAT |
  | ----- | -----
  | Standard storage | ₽1.2610 |

{% endlist %}

Here is an example of proportional calculation: let's say the user stores 15 GB of data for 11.5 hours during a month that is 30 days long. The total cost of storage can be calculated using the formula:

```
Storage_cost = Cost_per_GB_per_month * 15 * 12 / 24 / 30
```
