# Changing the master

If a cluster consists of multiple hosts, you can make a replica of the master if necessary. It takes about two minutes on average to switch, and the cluster is available during that time.

To switch the master:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console
  1. Go to the folder page and select **{{ mrd-name }}**.
  1. Select the appropriate cluster from the list.
  1. Open the **Hosts** tab.
  1. Click **Switch master**.
  1. In the window that opens, check **I want to switch the master** and click **Switch**.

{% endlist %}
