# Relationship between service resources

The main entity used in {{ mch-name }} is a _database cluster_.

Each cluster consists of one or more _database hosts_, which are virtual machines with DBMS servers deployed on them. Cluster hosts may reside in different availability zones and even different availability regions. [Learn more about Yandex.Cloud geography](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).

* A cluster consisting of multiple hosts has automatic failover, because the hosts can take over each other's functions as the cluster's primary replica.

* A single-host cluster doesn't guarantee fault tolerance. To add replicas, first [add the {{ ZK }} hosts](../operations/zk-hosts.md) that manage replication and query distribution across the cluster hosts.

When creating a cluster or shard, specify the _host class_, which is a template of virtual machine characteristics for the hosts deployed. For a list of available host classes and their characteristics, see [{#T}](instance-types.md).

A database cluster created in a folder can be accessed by all VMs connected to the same cloud network. [Learn more about networking](../../vpc/).
