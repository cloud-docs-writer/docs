# Dashboards

_Dashboards_ are sets of widgets: charts, text blocks, and titles. Metrics on dashboard charts are displayed for a specific interval that is shared by all charts.

The default interval is one day. The interval can be set using preset ranges (`1h 3h 1d 1w 1mo`). You can also set the beginning and the end interval.

To set the time interval more precisely, you can use the timeline located above the dashboard.

For Yandex.Cloud users, Monitoring provides service dashboards that contain predetermined widgets with metrics on the status of cloud resources. Service dashboards are created automatically.
