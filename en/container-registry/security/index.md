# Access management

Yandex.Cloud users can only perform operations on resources that are allowed by the roles assigned to them.
If a user doesn't have any roles assigned, almost all operations are forbidden.

To allow access to resources of the {{ container-registry-short-name }} service (registries and Docker images),
assign applicable roles to the user from the list below. For now, a role can only be assigned to a parent resource (folder or cloud), whose roles are inherited by nested resources.

{% note info %}

For more information about role inheritance, see [{#T}](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#access-rights-inheritance) in the {{ resmgr-full-name }} documentation.

{% endnote %}

## Assigning roles

To assign a role to a user:

{% include [grant-role-console](../../_includes/grant-role-console.md) %}

## Roles

The list below shows all roles that are considered when verifying access rights in the {{ container-registry-short-name }} service.

### Service roles

_Service roles_ are roles that allow access to the resources of a particular service.

{% include [cloud-roles](../../_includes/cloud-roles.md) %}

{% include [container-registry-puller](../../_includes/roles-container-registry-puller.md)%}

{% include [container-registry-pusher](../../_includes/roles-container-registry-pusher.md)%}

### Primitive roles

You can assign primitive roles to any resource in any service.

#### {{ roles-viewer }}

A user with the `{{ roles-viewer }}` role can view information about resources, for example, view a list of registries or pull a Docker image.

#### {{ roles-editor }}

A user with the `{{ roles-editor }}` role can manage Docker images, for example, push or delete them.

In addition, the `{{ roles-editor }}` role includes all permissions of the `{{ roles-viewer }}` role.

#### {{ roles-admin }}

A user with the `{{ roles-admin }}` role can manage access rights to resources, for example, allow other users to view registries or work with Docker images.

In addition, the `{{ roles-admin }}` role includes all permissions of the role of `{{ roles-editor }}`.
