# Create a fixed-size group with a load balancer

You can create a fixed-size group along with a network load balancer that will evenly distribute the load across cloud resources. For more information, see [{#T}](../../../load-balancer/concepts/index.md) in the {{ load-balancer-full-name }} documentation.

{% include [warning.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/warning.md) %}

To create an instance group with a load balancer:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. In the management console, select the folder where you want to create an instance group.
  1. Select **{{ compute-full-name }}**.
  1. On the **Virtual machines** page, go to the **Instance groups** tab.
  1. Click **Create group**.
  1. In the **Basic parameters** section, enter:
      - A group name in the **Name** field. The group name must be unique within the cloud.

          {% include [name-format](../../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

      - A group description in the **Description** field.
  1. In the **Allocation** section, select availability zones. Cluster VMs may reside in different availability zones and regions. [Learn more about the Cloud geography](../../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).
  1. In the **Instance template** section, click **Add**:
      - Select the required public [image](../images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md).
      - In the **Disks** section:
          - Select the [disk type](../../concepts/disk.md#disks_types) (HDD or SSD).

          - Specify the disk size.

              To add more disks, click **Add disk**.
      - In the **Computing resources** section:
          - Select the platform.
          - Specify the necessary number of vCPUs and amount of RAM.
      - In the **Network settings** section:
          - Select the [cloud network](../../concepts/vm.md#network).
          - Specify if a public IP address is required.
      - In the **Access** section, specify data required for accessing the VM:
          - Enter the username in the **Login** field.

          - In the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the public key file.

              You need to create a key pair for SSH connection yourself. To generate keys, use third-party tools, such as `ssh-keygen` utilities on Linux and macOS or [PuTTygen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) on Windows.
      - Click **Add**.
  1. In the **Deployment** section, specify:
      - Expansion of group size for scaling up.

      - Reduction of group size for scaling down.

      - Maximum number of instances when creating a group.

      - Maximum number of instances when deleting a group.

          For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/instance-groups/policies.md#deploy-policy).
  1. In the **Scalability** section:
      - Select the [scale type](../../concepts/instance-groups/scale.md).
      - Specify the required number of instances.
  1. In the **Integration with {{ load-balancer-name }}** section, switch the **Create target group** option to the right.
  1. Click **Create**.

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install.md](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue.md](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. See the description of the CLI's create instance group command:

      ```
      $ yc compute instance-group create --help
      ```

  1. Check whether there are networks in the folder:

      ```
      $ yc vpc network list
      ```

      If there aren't any, [create the necessary networks](../../../vpc/operations/subnet-create.md) in the {{ vpc-short-name }} service.

  1. Select one of the [public images](../images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md) (for example, CentOS 7).

      {% include [standard-images.md](../../../_includes/standard-images.md) %}

  1. Create a YAML file with any name (for example, `template.yaml`).

  1. In the created file, specify:

      - General information about the group:

          ```
          name: first-instance-group-with-balancer

  1. Create an instance group in the default folder:

      ```
      $ yc compute instance-group create --file template.yaml
      ```

      This command creates a group of three similar instances with the following characteristics:
      - Named `first-instance-group-with-balancer`.
      - Running on CentOS 7.
      - In the `default-net` network.
      - In the `ru-central1-a` availability zone.
      - With a single core and 4 GB RAM.
      - With a 32 GB network HDD.
      - With a target group named `first-target-group`.

  1. Create a [load balancer](../../../load-balancer/operations/load-balancer-create.md) and add the `first-target-group` target group to it .

- API

  Use the [create](../../../_api-ref/compute/api-ref/InstanceGroup/create.md) API method.
