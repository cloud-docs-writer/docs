# Creating a disk snapshot

_A disk snapshot_ is a copy of the disk file system at a certain point in time.

## Preparation {#prepare}

A disk snapshot contains only the data written to disk when creating the snapshot. If the disk is attached to a running VM, the cache of the apps and OS will not be included in the snapshot.

To ensure the integrity of the snapshot data:

**For Linux systems:**

1. Stop all disk write operations in the apps.
1. Run one of the following commands:
    - `sync` to write the OS cache to disk
    - `fsfreeze -f` to freeze the file system. To unfreeze it, run the `fsfreeze --unfreeze` command.

**For any other systems:**

1. Stop the VM (see [{#T}](../vm-control/vm-stop-and-start.md#stop)).
1. Wait until the VM's status changes to `STOPPED`.

## Creating a snapshot {#create}

To create a disk snapshot:

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. In the management console, select the folder where the disk is located.
  1. Click on the **Compute Cloud** tile.
  1. On the **Virtual machines** page, go to the **Disks** tab.
  1. In the line with the disk name, click ![image](../../../_assets/dots.svg) and select the **Create snapshot** command.
  1. Enter the snapshot name.

      {% include [name-format](../../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

  1. If necessary, enter an arbitrary text description of the snapshot.
  1. Click **Create snapshot**.

- CLI

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. See the description of the CLI's create snapshot commands:

      ```
      $ yc compute snapshot create --help
      ```

  1. Select the disk to take a snapshot of. To get a list of disks in the default folder, run the command:

      {% include [compute-disk-list](../../../_includes/compute/disk-list.md) %}

  1. Create a snapshot in the default folder:

      ```
      $ yc compute snapshot create \
          --name first-snapshot \
          --description "my first snapshot via CLI" \
          --disk-id fhm4aq4hvq5g3nepvt9b
      ```

      This command creates a disk snapshot with the name `first-snapshot` and description `my first snapshot via CLI`.

      {% include [name-format](../../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

{% endlist %}

A snapshot is created asynchronously. The snapshot is created immediately after the create command is run. It gets the `CREATING` status. From this point on, you can resume writing data to disk, and disk operations will not affect the data in the snapshot.

Once the snapshot has been created, its status changes to `READY`. From this point on, you can use the snapshot for creating images, filling disks, and so on.
