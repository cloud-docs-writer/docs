# Changing VM computing resources

After creating a VM, you can change its computing resources: the number and guaranteed performance of processor cores (vCPUs) and the amount of RAM.

For more information about how to change the name, description, and tags of a VM, see the section [{#T}](vm-update.md).

- Management console

  1. In the management console, select the folder the VM belongs to.
  1. Click on the **Compute Cloud** tile.
  1. Select the VM.
  1. Go to the VM's page.
  1. Click **Stop** in the top right corner of the page.
  1. Wait until the VM status changes to `STOPPED` and click **Update VM** in the top right corner of the page.
  1. Change the VM's configuration: in the **Computing resources** section:
      - Choose the platform.
      - Specify the required amount of vCPUs and RAM.
  1. Click **Save changes**.
  1. Click **Run** in the top right corner of the page.

- CLI

  {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. See the description of the CLI's update VM parameter command:

      ```
      $ yc compute instance update --help
      ```

  1. Get a list of VMs in the default folder:

      {% include [compute-instance-list](../../_includes_service/compute-instance-list.md) %}

  1. Select the `ID` or `NAME` of the VM you need (for example, `first-instance`).

  1. Stop the VM:

      ```
      $ yc compute instance stop first-instance
      ```

  1. Get information about the VM with the [metadata](../../concepts/vm-metadata.md):

      ```
      $ yc compute instance get --full first-instance
      ```

  1. Change the VM's configuration:

      ```
      $ yc compute instance update first-instance \
          --memory 32 \
          --cores 4 \
          --core-fraction 100
      ```

      This command will change the configuration of the VM:
      * **Guaranteed vCPU share**: by 100%.
      * **vCPU**: by 4.
      * **RAM**: by 32 GB.

  1. Start the VM:

      ```
      $ yc compute instance start first-instance
      ```

{% endlist %}
