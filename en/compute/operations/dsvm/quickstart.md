# Creating a VM from a public DSVM image

To create a VM:

1. Open the folder where the VM will be created.

1. Click **Create resource**.

1. Select **Virtual machine**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter the VM name.

    {% include [name-format](../../../_includes/name-format.md) %}

1. Select the [availability zone](../../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to locate the VM in.

1. Select a public DSVM [image](../images-with-pre-installed-software/get-list.md).

1. In the **Computing resources** section:
    - Choose the [platform](../../concepts/vm-platforms.md).
    - Specify the necessary number of vCPUs and amount of RAM.

1. In the **Network settings** section, click **Add network**.

1. In the window that opens, select the subnet to connect the VM to when creating it.

1. In **Public address**, choose:
    - **Automatically** — to set a public IP address automatically. The address is allocated from the pool of Yandex.Cloud addresses.
    - **List** — to select a public IP address from the list of static addresses. For more information, see the section [{#T}](../../../vpc/operations/set-static-ip.md) in the {{ vpc-name }} service documentation.
    - **No address** — to not assign a public IP address.

1. Specify data required for accessing the VM:
    - Enter the username in the **Login** field.
    - In the **SSH key** field, paste the contents of the public key file.
You need to create a key pair for SSH connection yourself. To generate keys, use third-party tools, such as `ssh-keygen` utilities on Linux and macOS or [PuTTygen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) on Windows.

1. Click **Create VM**.
